# Acceleration to center with fixed-point arithmetics and more accurate gravitation application

## Tasks

* Fixed-point calculations
* [Gravity law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration) applied 

## Results

### Fixed point calculations

### Gravity law

#### Gravity field
`g = -1 * R * ((G * M) / d ^ 2)`

where:

* `M` is large mass,
* `d` is distance between masses 
* `r` is unit-vector

#### Attraction force

`F = m * g`

where:

* `m` is sample mass
* `g` is gravity field

#### Calculation

TBD

#### Result
